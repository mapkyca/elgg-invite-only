Elgg Invite Only
================

This is a very simple plugin which makes your Elgg site invite only.

The plugin overrides the /register page, and checks for (and validates) the invitation code generated by the invite friends plugin built into Elgg. If those codes are present and
valid then the normal registration page is displayed, otherwise an error is displayed and the registration action is disabled.

Installation
------------

 * Install the plugin into your /mod directory and activate it.
 * To return registration back to normal simply deactivate the plugin.
